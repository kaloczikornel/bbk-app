This is a list of things that should be done by the time of deploying

    - encrypt the passwords and the ID card number at least
    - maybe set a minimum length for the password
    - need to check ID card number before letting the user register
    - auto deploy
    - do the checklist: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html



Would be nice if these features would be also implemented

    - unit test every middleware
